Here's how I did:

Puzzle | Solve Time	| # Attempts | Notes
--- | --- | --- | ---
0	| 2 hours |	1 | 
1	| 95 minutes	| 1 | 
2	| 18 minutes	| 1 | 
3	| 15 minutes	| 1 | 
4	| 375 hours	| 1 | Took a break for a few days
5	| 2 hours	| 23 | I really thought I had it...
6	| 77 minutes	| 1 | 
7	| 20 hours	| 1 | Took a break overnight
8	| 9 minutes	| 1 | 

I used SQL Server. I'm still getting to grips with learning SQL, and this challenge definitely helped me improve!
